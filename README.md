# Three-Brand-Refresh-Sketch-Library

READ ME (Temporary)

This is the working folder for the Three Brand Refresh Sketch Design Library and these are Work In Progress Master Files.

Please do not attempt to open these files and "Add as library" to your sketch files. Doing so means that you will not receive Library Updates.

Please also, do not open one of these master files and make edits without permission from myself. We are working on implementing a version control system soon.

Instead, please ask for a link to the relevant library, available in Sketch Cloud where you will be able to use these libraries as they evolve.

Guidelines are coming soon.



Library Dependencies:

Before using these libraries, please make sure to have the following Sketch Plugins installed:

	â€¢ Anima



Colour Palette

Feel free to import the .sketchpalette file. You will need the Sketch Palettes plugin to import this file in to Sketch.



Thanks!
